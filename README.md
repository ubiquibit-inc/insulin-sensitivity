# insulin-sensitivity
Insulin sensitivity by blood glucose concentration in closed-loop type 1 diabetics

#### Motivation

Provide a pipeline to calculate instantaneous insulin sensitivity factor (ISF) across blood glucose ranges. 

#### Background

The [OpenAPS](https:// openaps.org/) project provides tools for [\#WeAreNotWaiting](#wearenotwaiting) people interested in providing a closed-loop solution to type-1 diabetics. Participants upload glucose and treatment data to [OpenHuman](https://github.com/danamlewis/OpenHumansDataTools)

![Plot 1](img/plot.png) is representative of glucose and treatments over a 3 day period for an individual on standard CGM/Pump combo treatment.
